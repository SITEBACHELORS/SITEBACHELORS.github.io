  "driveStatement1":"If being full-time students during the summer taught us something, it is that Engineers struggle to find food in this period. ",
  "driveStatement2":"During the Fall and Winter period, SITE would be an engineer hotspot, however, durin Summer, one can appreciate a decrease in the engineers demographics in buildings such as SITE and STEM.   ",
  "driveStatement3":"While STEM is pretty much a food-free zone, SITE possesses a Tim Hortons as well as a food store that keep us well fed during classes. However, during Winter we find ourselves deprived from these food sources, which forces us to recurr to FSS buildings, thus, abandoning our roots and commuting more, not to mention that everythng closes at 3pm and we have classes later on.
